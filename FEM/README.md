# Mesh Generation
A personal project to show my academic output and skillset.

## Run
for 2D,
```

```
for 3D,
```
./run.sh 10 10 10
```
- arg 1: the number of elements in x
- arg 2: the number of elements in y
- arg 3: the number of elements in z

## Visualization with ParaView
Example 2D mesh with 40 elements in x and 10 elements in y;
